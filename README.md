EPSCoR Visualization 


**Big Goals:**  
Build the framework and documentation around a visualization effort using a collaboration platform that both Idaho and Alaska visualization experts can work together on.
Engage the new EPSCoR visualization faculty hire to be a partner with Idaho Visualization group

**Year One Goal:**  
Have Idaho students begin curating visualization tools, assets, and documentation on the collaboration platform using the focus area of Salmon Ecology on the Russian River.
Have a basic Unity demo of the SCTC - Russian River AOI with basics of area loaded:
terrain model, core vegetation assets, ??
(?) fish models + (?) code being modeled
(?) twiddles on environment

**Initial Kickoff Goals:**
Seth created GitHub: EPSCoR Visualization
https://github.com/orgs/EPSCoR-Visualization
Create initial core repository for issue tracking, documentation, and scripts to be hosted.
tutorials
visualization-russian-river
Have Seth ready to task the group create a GitHub account and add them to the organization
GitHub for Windows and OSX is probably best tool to get setup once
Point them at resouces like: http://guides.github.com/ to review 
Get a rough README, TODO started in the document and kick start the wiki
Pick a sane method of staying in sync that doesn’t involve a sad doodle poll everytime
a standing, open, but optional google hangout?

**Early April Goal:**
Have core datasets transferred to Idaho
Have basic instructions on how to setup and launch visualization environment
target user for testing: Dayne on a OSX or Windows machine - check out repo, follow instructions in repo, see environment
Review asset loading/hosting challenges team has run into and re-calibrate and scope year 1 goals better.

Visualization group - will be focusing on SCTC for Y2 and Y3 of EPSCoR - A Salmon ecology focus.
GINA need to help identify the source datasets needed and what formats to provide them in
The known stuff now: 1960’s usgs photos, 1980s ahap, 2013 aerial imagery mosaic, the cleaned up (from Rick) kenai lidar (DSM and DTM - probably not point cloud)
What else is there?
Need to document the framework for providing these datasets to this visualization group so we can have CIS apply this framework to the other test cases in years 4 and 5.
Goal have a visualization framework in place for SCTC by end of Year 3.
Goal for Y2 would be to identify, document, and deliver the base data needed for visualization.
